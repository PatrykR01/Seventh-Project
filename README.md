SUMMARY -> SEVENTH PROJECT<br>
<br>
This project show me what I need to do to get better as a JS developer. From now on I know how to build simple but logical games like that one. I know that DRY is very important in projects and I develop it more this time. I met more closely query selectors and how to use them. And one of most important things that I catched from this one is that I developed more my skills in finding issues and think logical to make more difficult things in JS.
